ENGR 190W
	- under control. Need to start working on project 2, and have other minor assignments, perhaps briefly study for the quizzes by reviewing the manual. Nothing too scary.
BIO M118L
	- under control. I have completed about half the work required and should end the quarter with an A
EECS 112
	- uncertain. I understand the content well enough, but won't be able to know where I stand until after the exam. Regardless, it can only harm my GPA, not stop me from graduating.
EECS 217
	- uncertain. I understand the material reasonably well, although I haven't started trying to use Cadence for designing a ring oscillator and its layout yet.
BIO 179L
	- doing poorly. I need to turn in a better lab report next time and actually put some effort into it if I want to pass the class.
CHINESE 
	- doing poorl. I don't know how much work I need to put in to maintain my current grade in the class, or where to target that work. I think using quizlet + quizzing myself using the text + reading the dialogues and trying to translate them, I should be good to graduate.
