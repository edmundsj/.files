Why Learning Facts is Still Necessary
=====================================

There is this line of thinking in the modern world that goes "Now that we have access to the world's information at the click of a button, there's no need to memorize things. Capitals of the world, bah! This is what Google is for." There is a great deal of truth to this statement. You would certainly be foolish to memorize trivial information, like phone numbers of your entire social network, or names of all the towns in Montana. It might make for fun trivia at parties, but not so much for a fulfilling and productive work life. 

This argument, however, makes the mistake of lumping all information into the same category, what I will call "dead" information. Why is the information dead? Because understanding it isn't terribly helpful or useful. Memorizing this information only has the benefit of making access quicker. If you know your friend's address off the top of your head, you won't have to look it up in your contacts list. 

So if some information is "dead" then what kind of information is "living"? I am an electrical engineer by training, and so will rely heavily on my physics and mathematics background to provide examples. Living information is information that allows you to subsequently understand *other information*. Alive information helps you build mental models of the world, and is not only useful for its own sake, but for understanding other things, which you may want to look up on Google. Let's say you're interested in learning more about quantum mechanics, because you saw a fascinating lecture on the subject. You promptly pull up your trusty search engine, and search "quantum mechanics". You pull up the wikipedia page for it, and are immediately blasted with a terrifying array of bizarre images and mathematical notation. The information is available for anyone to see, but because you don't have a mental model for physics, you don't have the *living* information necessary to *understand* that information. It rolls off your mind like dewdrops on a leaf. 

Let's take another example from the realm of the social sciences. Let's say you learn in class about Maslow's hierarchy of needs. You think this is interesting, and so you decide to memorize it. The value of that memorized information is not that you can *interpret* the actions of other people using the *mental model* provided by Maslow's hierarchy. It's not valuable because you memorized some decades-old theory and can spout it as needed, that information is valuabe because of the way in which it helps you understand the world around you.

While I have made a dichotomy out of information, into living and dead, obviously the reality is a bit more blurred. Some information may be more alive than others, and this will depend on the person and what they concern myself with. For me, as an electrical engineer, mathematics and physics are the most alive sets of information I have ever encountered. I use them to understand not only my work, but the world given to me by my senses. The world can be incredibly beautiful when seen through the lens of physics. In contrast, you may never have to touch math. For you, the fact that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x) may be dead information. For me, it's more valuable and illuminating than almost any single other fact. Newton's laws are a great example of living information. At first, F = ma is just a fact to be memorized. But once you become more familiar with it, this single equation starts to give meaning and mathematical notation for all movement on any scale, and can be used to form a mental model about how things work, as well as making quantitative predictions.

I would like to stress that the separation between living and dead facts is not just about how those facts are *used*. You may frequently *refer* to a fact, but it doesn't help form a mental model of the world. The phone number of your parents, or a close friend, for example, may be a piece of information you have unintentionally memorized, but does absolutely nothing to help you in understanding *other* pieces of information. A living fact is one that is not only useful, but gives life to information. A dead fact needs life breathed into it by other living facts, by models for the world that take years to develop, and REQUIRE memorization. Do not believe the people who tell you memorization is dead. This is a pernicious lie. Understand the distinction between living and dead facts, and you will understand their confusion, as well as how to correct it.
