This is a literature review concerning multiple orgasms in males and the male sexual response.

SUMMARY

Robbins 1978 - 13 men who experience multiple orgasms through training
	Dunn 1989 - 21 men who experience multiple organsms
		Myers 1998 - man who can orgasm multiple times
		Wibowo 2015 - review of male multiple orgasm literature


Robbins 1978
	* N=13 men who were self-trained at multiple orgasms without ejaculation by inhibiting ejaculation, and their final orgasm contains ejaculation
	* Appears to be the paper that initially found multiple organsms in men
	* between 3 to 10 orgasms per intercourse session
	* each became aware of multiple orgasms after considerable sexual experience
	* after a while, needed no conscious effort to control ejaculation compared with earlier experiences
	* this is NOT the same as a controlled prolonged plateau phase before orgasm, these men had all the signs of orgasm.
	* the authors suggest men may be able to achieve multiple organsms through experience and learning.
	* Collected physiological data on these men to verify they were in fact having orgasms

Dunn 1989
	* Traditional assumptions are that orgasm in men occurs in two stages: ejaculation immediately followed by a refractory period. Looks like this is wrong.
	* Reference this heavily-cited book by Masters and Johnson "Human Sexual Response"
	* The book by Masters and Johnson equated ejaculation with orgasm. Apparently they are not the same, and don't need to coincide, not even in the male.
	* There is a book by Hartman and Fithian (1984) which is supposed to train men to become multiply orgasmic
	* At this time, Robbins 1978 is the only study on multiple orgasms in men.
	* Papers that cite this paper might have further study on the topic.
	* Hopefully these authors publish further on the topic.
	* Interviewed 21 men in this study, no physiological data.
	* Some men had always been multiply orgasmic, other men learned it late in life.
	* Men that learned to be multiply orgasmic used squeeze or the stop-start method to separate ejaculation from orgasm
	* Time frames for intercourse between 15 minutes and 2 hours without a noticable refractory period.
	* Apparently ejaculation can be partial or full during sex
	* Partial or nonejaculatory orgasms are a thing
	* After an orgasm continued stimulation or a warm environment (vagina/mouth) was needed to maintain an erection after an organsm
	* Apparently a nondemanding atmosphere and emotional closeness are necessary
	* Also apparently some women are not vaginally responsive.
	* About half the men in their sample became multiply orgasmic in their late 30's or 40's
	* Excellent quote from Kinsey et al (1948): "Nevertheless, skepticism over the possibility of repeated response in the male merely emphasizes the incapacity of even scientifically trained persons to comprehend that others may be made differently from themselves". 

	THIS PAPER HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED FOR CITATIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY RELEVANT ONES THAT I HAVE SAVED FOR LATER.



Myers 1998
	* Case study of a man who can orgasm with ejaculation multiple times
	* They did verify that he orgasmed 6 times during self-stimulation over 30 minutes, and only stopped because the room got too hot.
	
Wibowo 2015
	* Review on the literature of male multiple orgasms, extremely solid review paper. 123 total references, and 15 papers on multiple male orgasms proper.
	* Ejaculation and orgasm are not the same thing, and it appears that it may be ejaculation, rather than orgasm, that leads to the male refractory period.
	* Anal sphincter EMG activity appears to be the most reliable way to determine whether orgasm is occuring.
	* We basically don't know anything about the mechanisms of orgasm or the refractory period.
	* Again, ejaculation is separate from orgasm
	* Apparently doing cocaine or methamphetamine might help cause multiple male orgasms, although this data is hella unreliable.
	* Prostate cancer patients or castrated patients provide case studies in multi-orgasm without ejaculation
	* Loss of testosterone and sex reassignment surgery may allow for multiple orgasms without ejaculation
