Chapter 2 - Not all tasks are created equal
=================================================
	* In hindsight, duh, no shit. 
	* Minute-for-minute, some tasks are simply more valuable than others. Focus on those as much as physically possible.
	Impact Challenge: Which areas are the most valuable in terms of your productivity?
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		* He suggests using the 3 MVPs per day (Darren Hardy term)

(Y) Chapter 3 - Three Daily Tasks
==================================
	* The 'rule of three' = my calibration appointment. Decide what three things you want to accomplish by the end of the day and the end of the week. I don't really like the end of the week part.
	* The 'rule of three' works because of human's inherent limitations in being able to think of multiple things at a time. Three things are easy to keep top-of-mind.
	* The underlying principle is simplicity. We want to keep daily and weekly tasks simple enough to keep them top-of-mind and to be able to work mindfully towards them.

Chapter 4 - Energy Throughout the Day and your Biological Prime Time
=======================================================================
	* Work on your highest-value tasks in your biological prime time
	* Protect your biological prime time at all costs (i.e. make your morning routine as short as possible, and don't see friends until the late evening.)
	* I think energy is synonymous with willpower and ability to start a task.
	* It is critical you get enough sleep, exercise, and avoid alcohol.
	* It feels great to finish your most difficult task at the beginning of the day
	* He suggests I keep a time log (oh baby do I keep a time log) and an energy log

Chapter 5 - Cozying up to your most difficult tasks
====================================================
	* procrastination is human, but much easier to avoid if you have a set of well-defined tasks.
	* Some tasks are more aversive than others, i.e. writing essays ><
